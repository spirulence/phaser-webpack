This is a boilerplate Phaser 2.7 and Typescript 2.2 project built with Webpack 2.

Take a look at the `scripts` section of `package.json` to understand how it works.

To build the app, run:

----
npm run build
----

To start a dev server with hot reload:

----
npm run dev-serve
----

It will automatically open a browser on `http://localhost:3000/`.
